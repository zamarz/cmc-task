# To-Do List

## Overview

This is a basic To-Do List Application structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It currently contains the input field for adding new items, a button to submit the items, and a basic list.

The only functionality it has is changing the list item's styling depending on if the item's checkbox is ticked. It also provides a confirm or error dialogue depending on if the text input box contains text when the submit button is pressed.

In the future, the application will ideally have functionality for adding new list items, improved security, and the ability to save items to localStorage or a database.

## Run the project

Simply clone and download the repo to your local PC. Open the files in your preferred IDE before going live on your internet browser.
